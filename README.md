## Abstract

Time series analysis is a method for analyzing data in-order to spot trends and predict what will happen in the future. We’re going to carry out time series analysis on two types of data i.e. seasonal and non-seasonal data. This project will provide a procedure to analyze and model time series in R. The first part covers analysis and forecast of monthly sales of a Retail Shop. The data is the number of general sales every month for nearly ten years. Approaches of time series analysis are auto-regressive integrated moving average(ARIMA), seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average(SARIMA), auto-regressive moving average(ARMA), moving average(MA) and auto-regression(AR). The second part deals with the time series of JPMorgan Stock to analyze and forecast the further prices . The core of the project is to provide a guide to ARIMA and ARCH-GARCH and look at the combined model’s output and effectiveness in time series modeling and forecasting.
